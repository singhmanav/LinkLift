# LinkLift
LinkLift is a scalable deep linking service built with FastAPI (Python backend), React (frontend), and PostgreSQL.It allows dynamic link generation with redirection behavior based on whether the target app is installed, fallback to web views, and even App Store redirects. All of this is fully configurable via a custom admin dashboard.
